# MyFirstPlugin

This is my first experiment in building audio plugins using JUCE and C++.
The plugin currently implements a **basic delay effect** with a fixed delay time (~0.1s).

The long-term goal is to progressively build up to more complex audio effects,
with a specific aim to implement a **comb filter** in the future.

### Tools Used
- C++17
- JUCE Framework
- CMake
- VST3 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022
