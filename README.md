# MyFirstPlugin

This is my first experiment in building audio plugins using JUCE and C++.
Currently, the plugin simply reduces the input volume by half.

The goal is to progressively build up to more complex audio effects,
with a specific aim to implement a **comb filter** in the future.

### Stack
- C++17
- JUCE Framework
- CMake
- VST3 SDK
