# MyFirstPlugin

This is an early-stage experiment in building audio plugins using JUCE and C++.

The project is inspired by Reasonâ€™s Thor comb filter - particularly its ability to push resonance beyond 100%.
The goal is to explore comb filtering and delay-based effects, and eventually introduce unique twists of my own, though the final direction is still evolving.

### Tools Used
- C++17
- JUCE Framework
- CMake
- VST3 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022
